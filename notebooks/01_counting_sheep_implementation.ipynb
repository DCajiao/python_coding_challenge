    "### **Counting Sheep - Python Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the implementation for the \"Counting Sheep\" challenge. The problem consists of helping Bleatrix, a sheep with insomnia, by counting multiples of a number `N` until she has seen all digits (0-9) at least once, or determining that it is impossible (resulting in insomnia). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will build functions in Python to process test cases where Bleatrix chooses a number `N`, and for each case, determine the last number Bleatrix counts before falling asleep or if she suffers from insomnia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook imports necessary functions from `src/sheepfunctions.py` and processes the provided input data, producing the required outputs in the `output/` directory."
